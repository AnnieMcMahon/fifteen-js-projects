# Fifteen JavaScript Projects
I used the starter code and step-by-step video from John Smilga to create fifteen simple JavaScript projects:

[GitHub starter code](https://github.com/john-smilga/javascript-basic-projects)

[YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PHXvlpOkf4&t=421s)

I then refactored some of the code to JS6 and created a main page to access all those projects easily, as well as a global CSS page to eliminate redundant code.

I had a lot of fun creating those projects, and John is an excellent teacher. By the end of the fifteen projects, I was able to follow along and keep up with his coding. I learned a lot along the way and gained valuable experience. Thank you, John, for making those projects and step-by-step video available!
